extended_description = """\
A CPU load balancer for the command-line, written in Rust and inspired by \
GNU Parallel. The purpose of the application is to parallelize otherwise \
serial tasks by evenly distributing tasks to all CPU cores in a system.

The program is supplied with a command template and a list of inputs, \
where those inputs will be evenly passed to each core in the system. \
Inputs are processed serially in parallel, as in each job will be assigned \
the next task in the queue as soon as a job completes. In addition, the \
standard output/error of each task will be buffered so that they are \
printed in the order that inputs are received, as if the commands were \
executed serially in a traditional for loop."""
